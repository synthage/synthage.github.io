So, I guess this is the beginning of this blog, and more importantly, the first post that will ever be seen on the website. You know, before this was posted, I could have written absolutely anything here, my social security number, my passport information, my credit card routing number, but no one will ever know if I actually have those things...

Anyways, this site was relatively easy to design, Jekyll was used for the production of the blog portion, bootstrap for the common outline elements because I was too lazy to entirely design my own CSS sheets like they did, but the theme and the rest of the CSS elements are 100% home grown.
